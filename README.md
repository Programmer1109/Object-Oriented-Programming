# Object-Oriented-Programming
This repository contains some basic tutorials for explaining Object oriented programming(OOP) concept.
The tutorials contain codes written in Python programming language. 
For the object oriented programming with Python I have reffered to the video tutorial by 'Telusko'.
Therefore, for a depper and more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter refer to his video tutorial.
Link to his youtube video for OOP in python - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiSCMNBIP2g". 
I have also planned to make similar tutorials in C++.
